## Adding Scripts

The easiest way to add these scripts is with the URL which allows for easy updates later.

1.  Install [Violent Monkey](https://violentmonkey.github.io/) on the browser of your choice - I recommend pinning it to the toolbar.
2.  Click the extension, then the Gear icon to open the dashboard.
3.  Click the '+' in the top left corner and choose 'Install from URL'
4.  In a separate tab, navigate to the script of your choice.
5.  Click the 'Raw' button on the right hand side.
6.  Copy and paste this URL into the ViolentMonkey URL box.
7.  Click 'OK', then 'Confirm Installation' on the next page.
8.  Reload the dashboard to see the new script added.

Now when you navigate to the page from '// @match' near the top of the script, the script will execute.
